# MLProjects

Welcome to MLProjects! This repository is a collection of small machine learning projects that cover a variety of topics and concepts in the field of machine learning. Each project focuses on solving a specific problem and provides an example of how to apply machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore the projects listed here. If you're new to machine learning, these projects can serve as great learning resources and examples to get you started. For those already familiar with ML, you might find inspiration for further experimentation and exploration.

## Projects

### Diabetic Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a person has diabetes based on certain medical features. It demonstrates classification techniques in machine learning.
